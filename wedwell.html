                They were both so relaxed and easy to work with. I really love timelines 
                and they did a great job at moving the day along without making it stressful. 
                I never had to worry about anything! It only took a month to get all of our 
                edited photos and they are absolutely beautiful! I just love looking through 
                them with my now husband and family.</p>

                They worked extremely well with a couple who usual hate having they photos taken! The outcome 
                was exactly what we wanted, natural and creative shots capturing both the little and big moments 
                of the day. I would highly recommend them to all. We are both extremely happy with the pictures!</p>

                photos were gorgeous and brought a tear to our eye when we saw the lovely shots taken with my mum. 
                We had a mini dress rehearsal photo shoot with my mum prior to the wedding and I'm glad we did, such 
                beautiful photos, thank you so much Luke for capturing our special day.</p>
